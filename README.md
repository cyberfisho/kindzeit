👋 Hi there
- :palm_tree: I’m @kayajammin. Feel free to just call me Paola. Fairly new to the coding world. 
And this is the first time I'm taking it seriously after my uni graduation. Based in Perth at the moment.
- :earth_asia: Learning language is always part of my interests. When I self-learn a language, I have to read it out loud without caring my imperfect pronouciation; love to write down new words I learn from anything as well. 
Looks like apart from French or German, HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be the new scribbles on my A4 paper. In my spare time, I enjoy watching films, and cycle or job a bit.
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on the basics of web development. Mostly front-end materials. 
- :purple_heart: I think when I am ready, I'll know when to look for collaboration. Not so desperately seeking frinds, but I'd like to meet you! 
If my profile ever get to your attention, I mean.
- 📫 Flick me a message: <a href="mailto: 29014782+kayajammin@users.noreply.github.com">Email</a>
